      <p> In our final year we identified early on that we had no artists on our team and therefore we chose to use an app called Magicavoxel which allowed us to quickly create all the assets we needed but also locked us to a voxel art style. We were a small 5 person team consisting of two programmers, one animator, two designers; who used agile and scrum effectively throughout the 7 month project.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>The Witching Hour is a casual, single player puzzle game developed by Crookodile. It is designed entirely for PC release through digital download. The game was developed by a small team of 8 people who used agile and scrum to rapidly prototype the game and then iterate on this.</p>

      <p>After learning python we were split into small groups and tasked with making a game using the Pygame library. This is made entirely in pygame with no extra libraries.</p>

      <p>First year of university we were split into random groups and tasked with building a game in unreal engine 4. We came up with the idea of a horror game where a domestic robot ai has turned on the player and wants to live.</p>

      <p>This is my own little side project, I will be working on this throughout the duration of my time at University and hopefully by the end of the course I will have a feature filled game created entirely by myself. I belive this to be an excellent way for me to learn all about unreal while also broadening my skill set.</p>
